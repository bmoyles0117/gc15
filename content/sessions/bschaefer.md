Go lets you to compile your program into stand-alone binaries which can be safely shared across systems without worrying about a missing dependency.

But there's one thing even a stand-alone executable depends on: the operating system. What if you could remove that dependency, too?

AtmanOS is a project built to explore that question.

It allows you to compile ordinary Go programs and run them on cloud providers like Amazon's EC2, without a traditional operating system.

Let's explore how it works, how to use it, and some considerations for putting it into production.
